[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/halexand/2016-ilo-binder)

My Binder setup takes a repo that you have defined on your github page. Copy/paste the url of the repo into mybinder.org to generate the binder badge (see above). 

If you open the binder it will automatically generate a run environment that has a terminal and a Python2/3 environment.
